      <p className="text-center text-xl text-zinc-400 max-w-2xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
        I’m an IT graduate from Universitas Islam Nahdlatul Ulama Jepara (UNISNU
        Jepara) with a strong interest in full-stack development. I love
        creating clean and functional applications using PHP, CodeIgniter 4,
        Laravel, MySQL, and modern UI frameworks like Tailwind CSS and
        Bootstrap.
      </p>

      <p className="text-center text-xl text-zinc-400 max-w-2xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed">
        I also explore mobile development with Flutter and backend services like
        Appwrite. Recently, I’ve been focusing on React, Next.js, and modern
        JavaScript to strengthen my versatility as a developer.
