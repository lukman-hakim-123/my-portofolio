      <p className="text-center text-xl text-zinc-400 max-w-2xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
        I'm an IT graduate from Universitas Islam Nahdlatul Ulama Jepara (UNISNU
        Jepara) with a strong interest in full-stack web development.
      </p>

      <p className="text-center text-xl text-zinc-400 max-w-2xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed">
        I enjoy building clean, simple, and functional applications—both on the
        front-end and back-end. My experience mainly includes working with PHP,
        CodeIgniter 4, Laravel, MySQL, and modern UI frameworks like Tailwind
        CSS and Bootstrap.
      </p>

      <p className="text-center text-xl text-zinc-400 max-w-2xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed">
        I also explore mobile development with Flutter and backend services like
        Appwrite. Recently, I'm focusing on improving my skills in React,
        Next.js, and modern JavaScript to become a more versatile developer.
